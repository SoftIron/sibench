.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
Each benchmarking node runs Sibench as a server daemon, listening for incoming
connections from a Sibench client.
.sp
Once the client starts a benchmark, the Sibench servers send periodic summaries
back to it, so that the user can see progress.
.sp
When a benchmark completes, the Sibench servers send the full results back to
the client.  A summary of the results is dislplayed by the client, but the full
results of every individual read and write operation are written out as a json
file in case the user wishes to perform their own statistical analysis.
.sp
Once a client starts running a benchmark on some set of Sibench servers, those
servers will reject any other incoming connections until the benchmark completes
or is aborted.  There is no job queue or long\-lived management process.
.sp
The client and server use the same binary, just with different command line
options.  The client is extremely lightweight, and may be run on one of the
server nodes without significantly impacting benchmarking performance.

.TE
.SS Targets
.sp
The targets are the nodes to which the worker threads connect.  Each worker
opens a connection to each target and round\-robins their reads and writes across
those connections.
.sp
For most Ceph operations, the targets are monitors, and there is no advantage to
specifying more than one.  All the monitors do is provide the
state\-of\-the\-cluster map so that the workers can connect to the OSDs directly.
.sp
For RGW/S3, however, you should \fIdefinitely\fP list all of the storage cluster\(aqs
RGW nodes as targets, since those nodes are doing real work, and it needs to be
balanced.
.SS RBD
.sp
RBD behaviour is a little different than you might expect: Each worker creates
an RBD image per target, just big enough to hold that worker\(aqs share of the
\(aqobjects\(aq for the benchmark.  All reads and writes that the worker then does are
within the RBD image.
.sp
For example, if you have the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
10 Sibench nodes, each with 16 cores
.IP 2. 3
A single target monitor
.IP 3. 3
And object count of 1600 and an object size of 1MB
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then Sibench will create 160 workers (by default, it is one per core), each of
which will create a single 10MB RBD image, and then it will proceed to read and
write 1 MB at a time to parts of that image.
.SS Generators
.sp
Generators create the data that Sibench uses as workloads for the storage
system.  There are currently two of them, selectable with the \fB\-\-generator\fP
option.
.SS PRNG Generator
.sp
The PRNG generator creates data which is entirely pseudorandom.  It requires no
configuration, and is the default choice.  However, it has one shortcoming:
because it creates pseudorandom data, it is not compressible.  If you wish to
test compression in your storage system, then you will need need to create a
compressible workload.  The same restriction applies to de\-duplication
technologies.
.SS Slice Generator
.sp
The Slice generator builds workloads from existing files.  It aims to reproduce
the compressibility characteristics of those files, whilst still creating an
effectively infinite supply of different objects.
.sp
It works by taking a directory of files (which will usually be of the same type:
source code, VM images, movies, or whatever), and then loading fixed sized
slices of bytes from random positions within those files.  The end result is
that we have a library of (say) 1000 slices, each containing (say) 4Kb of data.
Both of those values may be set with command line options.
.sp
When asked to generate a new workload object the slice generator does the
following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Creates a random seed.
.IP 2. 3
Writes the seed into the start of the workload object.
.IP 3. 3
Uses the seed to create a PRNG just for this workload object.
.IP 4. 3
Uses that prng to select slices from our library, which are concatenated
onto the object until we have as many bytes as we were asked for.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This approach means that we do not need to ever store the objects themselves: we
can verify a read operation by reading the seed from the first few bytes, and
then recreating the object we would expect.
.sp
Note that the directory of data to be sliced needs to be in the same location on
each of the Sibench server nodes.
.sp
The drivers do \fInot\fP need to have the same files in their slice directories,
though it\(aqs likely that they will.  One option would be to mount the same NFS
share on all the drivers as a repository for the slice data.  Performance when
loading the slices is not a consideration, since it is done before the benchmark
begins, and so will not affect the numbers.
.SS Write cycles
.sp
The \fBcount\fP parameter determines how many objects we create.  However, for long
benchmarks runs, or for small counts or object sizes, we are likely to wrap
around and start writing from the first object again.  If this happens, Sibench
internally increments a cycle counter, which it uses to ensure that objects
written in different cycles will have different contents, even though the object
will still use the same key as previously.
.SS The prepare phase
.sp
Sibench either benchmarks write operations first and then read operations, or
else it benchmarks a mixture of the too (depending on the \fB\-\-read\-write\-mix\fP
option.  When benchmarking reads, or a read\-write mix, it must first ensure that
there are enough objects there to read before it can start work.  This is the
\fIprepare\fP phase, and that is what is happening when you see messages about
\(aqPreparing\(aq.
.sp
It also happens if we are doing separate writes and reads and we did not have a
long enough run time for Sibench to write all of the objects specified by the
\fBobject\-count\fP option.  In this case, the prepare phase will keep writing until
all the objects are ready for reading.
.SS Slow shutdown
.sp
There are times when Sibench can take a long time when cleaning up after a
benchmark run.  This is due to Ceph being extremely slow at deleting objects.
.sp
Future versions of Sibench may add an option to not clean up their data in order
to avoid this.  (For test clusters with no production data, it would be faster
to not have Sibench clean up, but to delete and recreate the Ceph pools
instead).
