2. Download a Sibench release from https://github.com/softiron/sibench/releases, for example::

       wget https://github.com/SoftIron/sibench/releases/download/0.9.8/sibench-amd64-0.9.8.tar.gz
       tar -xvf sibench-amd64-0.9.8.tar.gz

3. Copy the binary somewhere in your ``$PATH``, for example::

       sudo cp sibench /usr/local/bin/


You will not have a Sibench sever running if only installing the binary. You
can run it manually using ``sibench server`` command, or you can create a
systemd unit like `this one. <https://github.com/SoftIron/sibench/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/sibench.service>`__
