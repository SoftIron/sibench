2. Download a ``sibench`` release from https://github.com/softiron/sibench/releases, for example

   .. parsed-literal::
      wget h\ ttps://github.com/SoftIron/sibench/releases/download/|release|/sibench-amd64-|release|.tar.gz
      tar -xvf sibench-amd64-|release|.tar.gz

3. Copy the binary somewhere in your ``$PATH``, for example::

       sudo cp sibench /usr/local/bin/


You will not have a ``sibench`` sever running if only installing the binary. You
can run it manually using ``sibench server`` command, or you can create a
systemd unit like `this one. <https://github.com/SoftIron/sibench/blob/master/lib/systemd/system/sibench.service>`__
